# Tunnelman :pick::construction_worker:

A simple C++ rendition of the popular 2D arcade game, Dig Dug, with an added objective of finding all of the oil barrels :oil_drum: hidden in the map. The game gets increasingly difficult as the player progresses to later levels. 

Most of the files (including the Assets and irrKlang folders) responsible for the video game graphics, sound, and animation were provided by Carey Nachenberg. The following files listed below are files which I have modified to complete this project:
- Actor.h
- Actor.cpp
- StudentWorld.h
- StudentWorld.cpp

A precompiled and playable version of the game can be found in the TunnelMan folder. Only works on Windows!
